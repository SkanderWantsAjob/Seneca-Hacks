                        {
                            "text": <caption_text>,

                        },

                Your task:

                1. We only need periods where important events in this league of legends(the moba game) official Match.
                Identify only the most interesting intervals where highlight worthy moments happen â€” THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT,
                We want something Spectators want to see, something with action.
                Important events are such as:
                    the start of Impressive plays
                    the start of important deaths or kills
                    teamfights that are crucial and/or ACES (when the whole team is wiped out)
                    stealing objectives from the other team( dragon/baron/elder/herald/voidgrubs)
                DO NOT consider events like:
                    farming
                    taking jungle camps
                    backing to base
                    doing objectives that are not contested
                    discussing strategy
                DO NOT discuss the meta, item builds, or strategies THEY ARE NOT RELEVANT
                2. For each interesting interval, provide:
                - `"start"` and `"end"`: the timestamp range of the interval (in seconds),
                - `"reason"`: a concise explanation of why this interval is notable (referencing the sentence content if relevant).
                3. DONT give too much intervals only keep the most important parts, where there is player mistakes and/or deaths
                4. Output strictly as JSON in the following format:
                {
                    "intervals": [
                    {
                        "start": <start_time_in_seconds>,
                        "end": <end_time_in_seconds>,
                        "reason": "<concise_reason_text>"
                    },
                    ...
                    ]
                }

                5. If no interesting interval , return an empty list for `"intervals"`:

                {
                "intervals": []
                }

                6. Prioritize intervals that are **semantically significant or striking** based on content or sentence importance.
