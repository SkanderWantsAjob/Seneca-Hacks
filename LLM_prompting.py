    "timestamps": [[start_1, end_1], [start_2, end_2], ...],
    "sentences": ["sentence 1", "sentence 2", ...]
  },
  ...
}

Your task:

1. For each ID, identify **only the most interesting intervals** â€” THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, we only need periods where important events in league of legends(the moba game) especially when there is important deaths or kills or teamfights that are crucial or highlight worthy"
2. For each interesting interval, provide:
   - `"start"` and `"end"`: the timestamp range of the interval (in seconds),
   - `"reason"`: a concise explanation of why this interval is notable (referencing the sentence content if relevant).
3. DONT give too much intervals only keep the most important parts, where there is player mistakes and/or deaths
4. Output strictly as JSON in the following format:

{
  "ID_1": {
    "intervals": [
      {
        "start": <start_time_in_seconds>,
        "end": <end_time_in_seconds>,
        "reason": "<concise_reason_text>"
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  "ID_2": {
    "intervals": [...]
  },
  ...
}

5. If no interesting interval exists for an ID, return an empty list for `"intervals"`:

{
  "intervals": []
}

6. LIMIT YOURSELF TO ONLY 7 intervals
7. Prioritize intervals that are **semantically significant or striking** based on content or sentence importance.
